# Overview

This is a CRUD application in the form of a task/to do list.

I've never written a CRUD application, so my purpose for this project was to familiarize myself with the concept.

# Future Work

- As mentioned in my demo video, I ran into problems adding icons to the delete and edit actions. Figuring this out will be my first priority.
- Add multiple input fields. Ideas include task priority, time due, collaborators, and other notes.
- Allow user to reorder list.
